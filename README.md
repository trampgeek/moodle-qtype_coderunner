# CodeRunner

Version: 5.7.2+ August 29, 2025. Requires **MOODLE V4.3 or later + PHP >=8.1**. Earlier versions
of Moodle must use CodeRunner V4.

CodeRunner is a Moodle question type that allows teachers to run a program in
order to grade a student's answer. By far the most common use of CodeRunner is
in programming courses where students are asked to write program code to some
specification and that code is then graded by running it in a series of tests.
CodeRunner questions have also been used in other areas of computer science and
engineering to grade questions in which a program must be used to assess correctness.

NOTE: A few sample quizzes containing example CodeRunner questions
are available at [coderunner.org.nz](http://coderunner.org.nz). There's also
[a forum](http://coderunner.org.nz/mod/forum/view.php?id=51) there, where you
can post CodeRunner questions, such as
requests for help if things go wrong, or are looking for ideas on how to write some
unusual question type.
