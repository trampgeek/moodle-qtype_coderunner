$string['gradingcontrols_help'] = 'The default \'exact match\' grader
awards marks only if the output from the run exactly matches the expected value defined
by the testcase. Trailing white space is stripped from all lines, and any trailing
blank lines are deleted, before the
equality test is made.

The near-equality grader is similar except that it
also collapses multiple spaces and tabs to a single space, deletes all blank
lines and converts the strings to lower case.

The \'regular expression\' grader uses the \'expected\'
field of the test case as a regular expression (without PERL-type delimiters)
and tests the output to see
if a match to the expected result can be found anywhere within the output. For
example, an expected value of \'ab.*z\' would match any output that contains the
the characters \'ab\' anywhere in the output and a \'z\' character somewhere later.
To force matching of the entire output, start and end the regular expression
with \'\A\' and \'\Z\' respectively. Regular expression matching uses MULTILINE
and DOTALL options.

The \'template grader\' option assumes that the output
from the program is actually a
grading result, i.e. that the template tests *and grades* the student answer.
The only output from such a template program must be a JSON-encoded record.

If the template is a per-test template (i.e., not a combinator), the JSON string must describe a row of the
results table and should contain at least a \'fraction\' field, which is multiplied by TEST.mark to decide how
many marks the test case is awarded. It should usually also contain a \'got\'
field, which is the value displayed in the \'Got\' column of the results table.
The other columns of the results table (testcode, stdin, expected) can also
be defined by the template grading program and will be used instead of the values from
the testcase. As an example, if the output of the program is the string
<code>{"fraction":0.5, "got": "Half the answers were right!"}</code>, half marks would be
given for that particular test case and the \'Got\' column would display the
text "Half the answers were right!". Other columns can be added to the result
table by adding extra attributes to the JSON record and also to the question\'s
Result Columns field.

If the template is a combinator, the JSON string output by the template grader
should again contain a \'fraction\' field, this time for the total mark,
and may contain zero or more of \'prologuehtml\', \'testresults\',
\'epiloguehtml\', \'columnformats\', \'showoutputonly\', \'showdifferences\'
and \'graderstate\'.
The \'prologuehtml\' and \'epiloguehtml\' fields are html
that is displayed respectively before and after the (optional) result table. The
\'testresults\' field, if given, is a list of lists used to display some sort
of result table. The first row is the column-header row and all other rows
define the table body. Two special column header values exist: \'iscorrect\'
and \'ishidden\'. The \'iscorrect\' column(s) are used to display crosses or
ticks for 0 and 1 respectively. The \'ishidden\' column isn\'t
actually displayed but 0 or 1 values in the column can be used to turn on and
off row visibility. Students do not see hidden rows but markers and other
staff do. If a \'testresults\' table is supplied an optional
\'columnformats\' field can also be supplied. This should be a list
of strings, one per column excluding the \'iscorrect\' and the \'ishidden\'
columns. The strings specify the format to be used to display the cell values;
currently the only supported formats are \'%s\' for a normal string display
(which is sanitised and wrapped in a \'pre\' element) and \'%h\' for an html
value that should not be further processed before display.
The \'showdifferences\' field turns on display of a \'Show Differences\'
button after the results table if the awarded mark fraction is not 1.0.
The \'showoutputonly\' field, if true, is used when the question is to be
used only to display the output and perhaps images from a run, with no mark.
The \'graderstate\' variable is a string value that the question author can
use to pass grading information between question attempts. If included
in the grading response to a submission it will be available on the next
submission as the Twig variable \'QUESTION.stepinfo.graderstate\'.

language used by the Ace code editor (if enabled) for the student\'s answer.
By default this is the same as the sandbox language; enter a different
value here only if the template language is different from the language
that the student is expected to write (e.g. if a Python template is
used to preprocess a student\'s C program and then execute it in a subprocess).

Multi-language questions, that is questions that students can answer in
more than one language, are enabled by setting the Ace-language to a comma-separated
list of languages. Students are then presented with a drop-down menu to select
the language in which their answer is written. If exactly one of the languages
has an asterisk (\'\*\') appended, that language is chosen as the default language,
which is selected as the initial state of the drop-down menu. For example,
an Ace-language value of "C,C++,Java\*,Python3" would allow student to submit in
C, C++, Java or Python3 but the drop-down menu would initially show Java which
would be the default. If no default is specified the
initial state of the drop-down is empty and the student must choose a language.
Multilanguage questions require a special template that uses the {{ANSWER\_LANGUAGE}}
template variable to control how to execute the student code. See the built-in
sample multilanguage question type. The {{ANSWER\_LANGUAGE}} variable is defined
<i>only</i> for multilanguage questions.

If the author wishes to supply a sample answer to a multilanguage question,
they must write it in the default language, if specified, or the
first of the allowed languages otherwise.';

run before/after the test code, respectively. Default: <i>posttest</i> - for backward
compatibility (originally the extra code always ran after the test code).</p>
<h4>Usage information</h4>
The question author has to write
Python3 code to check the resulting graph.</p><p>Note that it is not actually
necessary to use this question type for directed graphs, as the functionality
is mainly provided by the GraphUI plugin. If the graph pre-processing performed
by this question type does not suit your needs, you can instead just use a normal
Python3 question (or any other language), set the UI to GraphUI, and analyse
the JSON-serialised version of the graph (the Twig STUDENT_ANSWER&nbsp; variable)
yourself. However, this question type does provide an example of how to use the
GraphUI plugin. Click <i>Customise</i>&nbsp;to see the template code.</p>
<p>The specification will ask the student to draw a directed graph to satisfy
certain requirements. It might for example be a DFA (deterministic finite-state
automaton) or a Turning machine. The test case code and/or the extra code will
then analyse the graph and print a message to the student, such as OK if the
graph is correct or a suitably informative error message otherwise.</p>
<p>The template for this question analyses the JSON-serialised graph, extracting
its topology in the form of an adjacency dictionary&nbsp;<i>graph</i>. This
variable is available to the test or extra code in the test case. Keys in the
dictionary are node names, if given, or arbitrary node identifying labels of
the form #1, #2 etc otherwise. Values in the dictionary are lists of outgoing
edges, sorted by neighbour node name or identifier, each edge being a tuple
(neighbourId, edgeLabel).</p><p>Each entry in the adjacency list is of the form
(nodeNameOrId, neighbours) where neighbours is a list of tuples
(neighbourNodeNameOrId, edgeLabel). If nodes are given names, those are used
as node identifiers, otherwise the names #1, #2 etc are used. The adjacency
list and the neighbour list are both sorted in order of node name or identifier.</p>
<p>The template is a combinator one: the <i>testcode</i>&nbsp;and
<i>extra</i>&nbsp;code are both executed for each test cae. With the <i>extra</i>
code running after (posttest) the test case, by default.</p><p>As a simple
example, if the specification were just "Draw a directed graph with two nodes
labelled A and B, with an edge from A to B", a suitable test case (albeit with
unhelpful error output) might be:</p><pre>
if set(graph.keys()) == {\'A\', \'B\'} and len(graph[\'A\']) == 1 and len(graph[\'B\']) == 0 and graph[\'A\'][0][0] == \'B\':
    print(\'OK\')
else:
    print(\'Nope\')
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, there could be a set of test cases, each one checking
one of the aspects of the specification. For example, the first test case might
print the sorted keys, expecting to see \'A\', \'B\'. The second test case might
print the outgoing edges from node \'A\', and so on.</p>';

each test case runs as a separate sandbox program.
</p><p>The program generated for each test case consists of the student answer, with
the <i>public</i>&nbsp;attribute stripped if present. That (now local)
class definition is followed by a public <i>__Tester__&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;class that
has a <i>main</i>&nbsp;method that instantiates the Tester class and calls its

template constructs a Main class containing the student-supplied method

write-a-function, write-a-class or write-a-program question types. It differs
from the slightly simpler <i>python3</i> question type in that the usual
python3 <i>input</i> function is replaced with a custom version that echoes
standard input to standard output as it is consumed. This results in the output
mimicking that which is seen by students when testing with keyboard input.
It is recommended instead for the <i>python3</i> question type for any
questions that involve calls to <i>input</i> in introductory programming
courses, where students are likely to be confused by the non-echoing of
standard input when taken from a file.</p><p>A slight downside of this question
type compared to the <i>python3</i> question type is that any error messages
in the student code will have confusing line numbers, since the substitute
input function is inserted before the student code.</p>
<p>For each
test case, the student-answer code is executed followed by the test code.
Thus, for example, if the student is asked to write a function definition,
their definition will be executed first, followed by the author-supplied
test code, which will typically call the function and print the result or
some value derived from it.</p>
<p>If there are no standard inputs defined for all test cases, the question
actually wraps all the tests
into a single run, printing a separator string between each test case output.
Please be aware that this isn\'t necessarily the same as running each test
case separately. For example, if there are any global variables defined by
the student code, these will hold their values across the multiple runs.
If this is likely to prove a problem, the easiest work-around is to define
one of the test case standard input fields to be a non-empty value - this
forces CodeRunner into a fallback mode of running each test case separately.</p>';

typically with just two or three elements. The first element is the column
header, the second element is the field from the TestResult object being
displayed in the column and the optional third element is an sprintf format
string used to display the field.

The fields available in the standard
TestResult object are: testcode, stdin, expected, got, extra, awarded, and mark.
testcode, stdin, expected and extra are the fields from the testcase while got

Per-test template-graders may
add their own fields, which can also be selected for display. It is also
possible to combine multiple fields into a column by adding extra fields to the
specifier: these must precede the sprintf format specifier, which then becomes
mandatory. For example, to display a Mark Fraction column in the form 0.74/1.00,
say, a column format specifier of ["Mark Fraction", "awarded", "mark",
"%.2f/%.2f"] could be used.

As a further special case, a format of %h means that
the test result field should be taken as ready-to-output HTML and should not be
subject to further processing; this is useful only with custom-grader templates
that generate HTML output, such as SVG graphics.

default value (typically 5 secs for the CPU time limit and a language-dependent
amount of memory), but the defaults may not be suitable for resource-demanding
programs. A value of zero for the maximum memory results in no limit being
imposed. The amount of memory specified here is the total amount needed for
the run including all libraries, interpreters, VMs etc.

The \'Parameters\' entry

API-keys. It should generally be left blank but if non-blank it must be a valid
JSON record. In the case of the jobe sandbox, available attributes include
disklimit, streamsize, numprocs, compileargs, linkargs and interpreterargs. For
example <code>{"compileargs":["-std=c89"]}</code> for a C question would force C89

specifies that the template is a combinator template, which combines (or attempts
to combine) the student answer plus all test cases into a single run. If this
checkbox is checked, you will also need to define the value of the test_splitter_re
field, which is the PHP regular expression used to split the output from the
program run back into a set of individual test runs. However, you do not need
to define this if you\'re also using a template grader, as in that case the
template code is responsible for splitting the output itself, and grading it.

Combinator templates do not get passed a TEST Twig variable. Instead they
receive a variable TESTCASES, which is a list of all the tests in the
question. The program produced by the template is generally assumed to combine the
STUDENT_ANSWER and all the TESTCASES into a single program which, when it is run,
outputs the test results from each test case, separated by a unique string.
The separator string is defined by a regular expression given by the form
field \'test_splitter_re\' below.

However, if testcases have standard input defined, combinator templates become
problematic. If the template constructs a single program, what should the standard
input be? The simplest (and default) solution is to
run the test cases one at a time, using the combinator template to build
each program, passing it a TESTCASES variable containing just a single test.
This \'trick\' allows the combinator template to serve a dual role: it behaves
as a per-test-case template (with a 1-element TESTCASES array) when the question
author supplies standard input but as a proper combinator (with an n-element
TESTCASES array) otherwise. To change this behaviour so that the combinator
receives all testcases, even when stdin is present, check the \'Allow multiple
stdins\' checkbox.

If a run of the combinator program results in any output to stderr, that
is interpreted as a run error. To ensure the student gets credit for as many
valid tests as possible, the system behaves as it does when standard input
is present, falling back to running each test separately. This does not
apply to combinator graders, however, which are required to deal with all
runtime errors themselves and must always return a valid JSON outcome.';

The \'is_combinator\' checkbox is left unchecked for a per-test template and is
set checked for a combinator template. The rest of this help panel assumes you
are using a per-test template; see the full documentation for the use of
combinator templates.

The template is processed
by the Twig template engine (see http://twig.sensiolabs.org)
in a context in which STUDENT_ANSWER is the student\'s
response and TEST.testcode is the code for the current testcase. These values
(and other testcase values like TEST.expected, TEST.stdin, TEST.mark)
can be inserted into the template by enclosing them in double braces, e.g.
<code>{{TEST.testcode}}</code>. For use within literal strings, an appropriate escape
function should be applied, e.g. <code>{{STUDENT_ANSWER | e(\'py\')}}</code> is
suitable for use within Python triple-double-quoted
strings. Other escape functions are <code>e(\'c\')</code>, <code>e(\'java\')</code>,
<code>e(\'matlab\')</code>. The program that is output by Twig is then compiled and executed
with the language of the selected built-in type and with stdin set
to TEST.stdin. Output from that program is then passed to the selected grader.
See the help under \'Grading controls\' for more on that.

Note that if a customised per-test template is used
there will be a compile-and-execute job submitted to the sandbox for every test case,
whereas most built-in question types define instead a combinator template that combines
all test cases into a single run.

If Twig All is checked, Twig macro expansion is applied to the
question text, sample answer, answer preload, UI parameters and all test case fields

need to turn on TwigAll if using randomisation within the template parameters.
Note that this Twig All expansion occurs when the question is first initialised, whereas
the Twig expansion of the template occurs much later, when the student submits
an answer. The environment for expanding the template includes the QUESTION
Twig variable (a subset of the entire question record), some fields of which
might have been expanded as a result of using Twig All.

The text in the template parameters field must either be JSON or must evaluate
to yield JSON when processed by the specified Preprocessor. Be warned that choosing
a preprocessor other than Twig results in a submission to the Jobe sandbox before
the question can even be displayed. See <a href="https://coderunner.org.nz/mod/url/view.php?id=199">

For a given seed the sequence of random question instances should be the same (assuming your question template uses the random seed it is given correctly).
