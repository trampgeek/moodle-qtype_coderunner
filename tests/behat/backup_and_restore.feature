  Scenario: Backup and restore a course containing a CodeRunner question
    When I backup "Course 1" course using this options:
      | Confirmation | Filename | test_backup.mbz |
    And I restore "test_backup.mbz" backup into a new course using this options:
      | Schema | Course name | Course 2 |

    And I am on the "Course 2 copy 1" "core_question > course question bank" page
    And I should see "Square function"

    # Edit the copy and verify the form field contents.
    And I choose "Edit question" action for "Square function" in the question bank

    Then the following fields match these values:
      | Question name                  | Square function                                 |
      | Question text                  | Write a function sqr(n) that returns n squared. |
      | General feedback               | No feedback available for coderunner questions. |
